Points to remember:
1. Strict Mode: In this all forms of errors are thrown otherwise js is not that severe when it comes to throwing errors

2. Closures : Ability of a function to remember its outer variables and functions 

3. Prototype: Every object in js contains prototype , it is also an object which contains several built in properties and functions .Like .getFullYear in Date, .push in Array prototype

4. this keyword not to be used inside arrow fncs
this inside normal functions : returns current object inside which the function is present

5. ...rest: used inside params of function to create an array of args
...spread: used to spread an array or object

6. Promise: used to handle asynchronous functions , it takes a callback function which contains 2 params resolve and reject , if the async operation is successfull it calls resolve , else reject
